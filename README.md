## Working Steps:

Therefore, we have fixed the column name of this dataset. It will help us to make relation in between two dataset “MemberBasic” and “MemberBasicExtra”. After that we have loaded the dataset to visualize it. 

Step 2:
We have PrimaryID considering primary key which helps us to connect both dataset. According to the relation of the each column and data we make visualization report to understand the dataset and analyze as well.
